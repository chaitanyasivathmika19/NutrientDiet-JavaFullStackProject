    <h1>Ectomorph Diet</h1>

    <!-- Food List Section -->
    <h2>Food List for an Ectomorph</h2>

    <!-- Advantages Section -->
    <h2>Advantages of the Ectomorph Diet</h2>
    <p>Compared to the eating plans for mesomorphs and endomorphs, the ectomorph diet is higher in carbs. So if you’re averse to low-carb diets, you may find this eating plan meshes well with your tastes — and that’s great, so long as you eat carbs in moderation. Thanks to your higher metabolism and body’s ability to process carbs, you’re likely able to eat carb-heavy dishes like pasta without as much risk as the other body types.</p>

    <!-- Workout Section -->
    <h2>Ectomorph Workout: Which Exercises Are Best for This Body Type?</h2>
    <p>“The rule for ectomorphs is weight lifting,” but if you tend to gravitate toward cardio, it’s suggested to pair it with bodyweight movements. Perform circuit workouts (such as pushups, squats, or jumping jacks) twice a week along with weight workouts that use dumbbells or machines (using a challenging weight) three times a week.</p>
