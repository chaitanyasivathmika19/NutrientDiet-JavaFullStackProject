    <h1>Mesomorph</h1>

    <!-- Body Type Description -->
    <h2>Body Type Description</h2>
    <p>If you could pass for Serena Williams or a professional football player, you may be a mesomorph. A mesomorph is one of the three main body types, according to proponents of the body type diet.</p>
    <p>A person who is a mesomorph is said to have more of an athletic body. “Their body structure is more rectangular or boxy. They’re also thin, but not wiry, and if they work out, they find they build muscle easily."</p>

    <!-- Food List Section -->
    <h2>Food List for a Mesomorph</h2>
    <p>The body type diet states that a mesomorph will do best with a well-balanced meal plan (40 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent fat), focusing on whole grains and starchy carbohydrates, healthy fats, and protein-rich foods. Catudal says this will provide the needed energy for workouts as well as nutrients for muscle repair. They can also usually eat more calories compared with the other body types, as their higher percentage of muscle means a speedier metabolism. Here are the recommended foods on a mesomorph diet:</p>

    <!-- Advantages Section -->
    <h2>Advantages of the Mesomorph Diet</h2>
    <p>Lucky for mesomorphs, “this body type is the most malleable through diet and exercise,” says Catudal. Meaning: While you can’t change your bone structure or frame, it may be easier for you to lose fat and build muscle. Another benefit is that someone who is more muscular and athletic may be able to generally tolerate more carbs, says Melina Jampolis, MD, an internist and board-certified physician nutrition specialist in Valley Village, California. And you will probably enjoy the satisfaction of being able to split your calories pretty evenly between carbohydrates, fat, and protein, rather than putting limitations on your diet and feeling deprived.</p>

    <!-- Workout Section -->
    <h2>Mesomorph Workout: Which Exercises Are Best for This Body Type?</h2>
    <p>Your ideal workout will depend most on your goals. “Weights will help you build muscle quicker, but cardio will help you drop weight quicker. Athletically, mesomorphs have it the best because they’re more responsive to exercise,” says Catudal. The one catch is that you’re at risk of hitting a plateau. “Mesomorphs maintain their bodies fairly easily, so there can be a tendency to not push yourself as hard,” he says. Switching up your workouts and giving your body something new can help prevent that stall.</p>
